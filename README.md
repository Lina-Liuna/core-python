### 2. The Python Standard Library

What Pythons's Standard Library Provide?

1. Wide Range of facilities

2. built-in modules(written in C) to access to system functionality such as file I/O

3. Standardized solutions for many problems that occur in everyday programming

4. Modules designed to abstracting away platforms â€”neutral APIs

5. Provides as a collection of packages, Collections of packages: python package index website
          https://pypi.org/
### 1. Python Tutorial.key & Python Tutorial.pdf is not for presentatioon(there is no graphs and it's not pretty enough, but real useful notes), it's only a note summary.

    python3 this: The Zen of Python, by Tim Peters

    Beautiful is better than ugly.
Explicit is better than implicit.
Simple is better than complex.
Complex is better than complicated.
Flat is better than nested.
Sparse is better than dense.
Readability counts.
Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
Although practicality beats purity.
Errors should never pass silently.
Unless explicitly silenced.
In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
Now is better than never.
Although never is often better than *right* now.
If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!
