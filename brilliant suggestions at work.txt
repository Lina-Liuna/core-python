Today is my last day (and emotional day) at Google. I am very thankful to all my managers, collaborators, teammates, interns and other colleagues in the last four years. I was very lucky to work with colleagues across multiple orgs - contact center AI, speech, brain, cloud vision … Thank you all! I learned so much from you.

To help nooglers or student interns who may get lost at their first day at Google, here are a few things I wish I could know four years ago:

##### advices on coding ######
- Google’s internal infra is like a super computer with one single code repository (search “borg” and “google codebase” for more context) which you should learn from others but also by yourself as much as you can.
- Using and debugging with borg (the “super computer”) is super important. I wish I could have learned 10x more from my coleagues/internal docs. It will affect your productivities a lot.
- For students just coming out of school, you may find programming at Google is very different compared with your previous experiences. But you may use python colab for small experiments
- Google’s codebase is (almost) always working! Thus a reliable way is to read unit tests (note that documents and people’s opinions are less reliable)
- Read others’ code submission history. You will learn a lot of skills and sometimes may connect the dots to tell an interesting story.
- Unfortunately Google’s borg (internally) is very different from GCP (Google Cloud Platform, for external users). Borg is better maintained and updates faster.
- No be afraid of difficult projects. Try to work with the people you admire.
- When joining a project, check if the documentations are expired. If yes, volunteer to update team documents.

##### advices on communication ######
- Ask your peers what are the best design docs they have seen. Understand why these are good, and learn from them.
- When talking with your (skip) managers, prepare good (or open-ended) questions so they can give you concrete information. For example, what are the top 3 successful projects in the team? What are the 3 big failures? What is your biggest worry of the team projects? Could you recommend 1-2 role models who I can learn from?
- If you think yourself bad with communication, try record your presentation and watch it afterwards. Ask your manager/peer their feedbacks. So next time you will do better.
you are doing so great!
you are doing so great!
you are doing so great!
