# yield expressions provide generator functions with a simple way to produce an iterable series of output values.
# this channel appears to be unidirectional: there is no immediately obvious way to simultneously stream data in and
# out of a generator as it runs.

# Example: I'm writing a program to transmit signals using a software-defined radio.
# I use a function to generate an approximation of a sine wave with a given number of points.
