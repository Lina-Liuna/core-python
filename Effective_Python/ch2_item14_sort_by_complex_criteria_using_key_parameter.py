# List Sort method

# The list built-in type provides a sort method for ordering the items in a list instance based on a
# variety of criteria.

# By default, sort will order a list's contents by the natural ascending order of the items.

# The sort method works for nearly all built-in types(strings, floats, etc.) that have a natural ordering to them.


# What does Sort do with objects?
