# Example: I want to analyze tourism numbers for the U.S. state of Texas,
# the data set is the number of visitors to each city
# I'd like to figure out what percentage of overall tourism each city receives.

# I need a normalization function that sums the inputs to determine the total number of tourists per year
# and then divides each city's individual visitor count by the total to find that city's contribution to the whole.
