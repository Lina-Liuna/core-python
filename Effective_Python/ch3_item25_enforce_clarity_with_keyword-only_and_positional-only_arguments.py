# Passing arguments by keyword is powerful feature of python functions.

# The flexibility of keyword arguments enables you to write functions for many use cases.

# too many arguments may cause position-confusing, and this is exception-ignoring behavior, cause bugs
# that are hard to track down.

# One way to improve the readability of this code is to use keyword arguments.

# But the problem is here: keyword arguments are optional behavior, there's nothing forcing callers to use
# keyword arguments for clarity.

# defining keyword-only arguments, the arguments can only be supplied by keword, never by position.
