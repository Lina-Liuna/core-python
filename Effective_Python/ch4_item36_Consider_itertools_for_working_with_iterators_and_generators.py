# The itertools built-in module contains a large number of functions that are useful for
# organizing and itteracting with iterators

import itertools

# whenever you find yourself dealing with tricky iteration code, it's worthy looking at the itertools
# The following sections describe the most important functions that you should know

# 1. Linking iterators together
    # 1. chain
    # 2. repeat
    # 3. cycle
    # 4. tee
    # 5. zip_longest
# 2. Filtering items from iterator:
    # 1. islice
    # 2. takewhile
    # 3. dropwhile
    # 4. filterfalse
# 3. Producing combinations of items from iterator:
    # 1. accumulate
    # 2. product
    # 3. permutations
    # 4. combinations
    # 5. combinations_with_replacement

# 1. Linking iterators together
# 1. chain : use chain to combine multiple iterators into a single sequential iterator.
