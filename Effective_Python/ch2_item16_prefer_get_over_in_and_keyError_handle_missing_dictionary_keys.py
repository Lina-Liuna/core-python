# The three fundamental operations for interacting with dictionaries:
# 1. accessing
# 2. assigning
# 3. deleting keys and their associated values

# The contents of dictionaries are dynamic, and thus it's entirely possbile - even likely -- when you try to access or
# delete a key, it won't already be present.
