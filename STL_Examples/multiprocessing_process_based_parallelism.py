# multiprocessing is a package that supports spawning processes using an API similar to the threading module.
# the multiprocessing package offers both local and remote concurrency.
# effectively side-stepping the global interpreter lock by using subprocesses instead of threads.
# the multiprocessing module allows the programmer to fully leverage multiple processors on a given machine.
