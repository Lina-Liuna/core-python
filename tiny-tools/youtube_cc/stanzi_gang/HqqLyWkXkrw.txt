hey sibs uh I've been thinking about it
and I think we should Purge the board
tonight uh what do you think yeah I feel
like murdering the entire board maybe
isn't the move
I don't know okay uh What uh the
shareholders are going to hate
you
um and the Market opens on Monday and
Jerry's not allowed to die until I've
seen her naked so okay uh gross shift
I'm sorry why don't you just kill Tom
well okay uh so could we just how does
that play exactly just I just want some
further uh clarification on that and uh
and and I'm not entirely opposed to the
idea I just uh could shift could we I
get it it's a big play
but I feel like we need to shake things
up a little bit you guys right right you
know we're kind of dead in the water
right now it's a little bit stale so why
don't we dust off this bookshelf
and do some spring cleaning you
guys I mean Dad wouldn't Purge the board
like maybe someone would lose a limb or
two
um this this feels like a wee bit much
you know just just like scalp Carl or
whatever I don't um yeah Dad would never
kill the whole board Ken um I know you
feel like you have something to prove
but I see your point big shoes
big big shoes how about this how about
we keep Jerry and we kill Frank Thomas
yeah sure whatever that's fine with me
oh well I well I heard uh Greg was
actually open to dying uh I think your
dad would have liked to see him go so
I'll just I'll ask him to pop in here
for a moment uh Greg Greg would you
would you mind uh just just uh stepping
inside here I think that for uh for my
own comfortability level I think that it
it suits me better on the on the
opposing the opposite uh side of the
door
